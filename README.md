# Car_Price_prediction_with_deployment_using_Flask
1. This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
2. It then predicts the possible price of the car. For example, the image below shows the predicted price of our BMW 7 Series 2019 model which already travelled 200000 kms.
